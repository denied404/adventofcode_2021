# AdventOfCode 2021

This repository contains my solutions to https://adventofcode.com puzzles in 2021 season.
The code neither is polished nor everywhere is made in an optimal way. Basically, what's contained here is a bunch of first working versions of puzzle solutions which gave right answers. I keep it here for my own purposes but don't mind if anyone glances over.

Every solution is written in ruby because I feel like at the moment it is a language which allows me to express myself in a most natural way.
